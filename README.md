# Fedora Release Schedule Ical

This tool generates a calendar with future milestones of multiple versions of Fedora.
The data comes from he official [Fedora schedule](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule).
We clean the calendar from excessive events spanning multiple years.
We add a Python-specific event to update fedora-obsolete-packages on each Final Freeze.
